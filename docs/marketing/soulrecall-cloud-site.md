# soulrecall.cloud marketing site plan (v1.0)

This document defines a launch-ready content and information architecture plan for `https://soulrecall.cloud`.

## Goals

1. Explain SoulRecall in under 30 seconds.
2. Convert visitors into active users with a direct install flow.
3. Publish trustworthy docs for teams evaluating long-term adoption.
4. Provide immediate paths for backup/recovery and operational confidence.

## Primary audiences

- **Indie agent builders**: want a fast start and clear commands.
- **AI engineers**: need architecture details, deployment patterns, and reliability guidance.
- **Teams and operators**: need security, backup, and recovery guarantees.

## Site map

- `/` — Landing page (product narrative + CTA)
- `/install` — Install + bootstrap instructions
- `/skills/clawdbot-claude` — Simple skill workflow for install/bootstrap/backup
- `/tutorial` — End-to-end v1.0 hands-on tutorial
- `/docs` — Full documentation index (v1.0)
- `/docs/*` — Task- and topic-based references
- `/pricing` (optional placeholder if OSS + hosted plans are expected)
- `/changelog` — Release notes and roadmap markers

## Landing page content outline (`/`)

### Hero

- **Headline**: "Run sovereign AI agents that stay online and recoverable."
- **Subheadline**: "SoulRecall packages local agents, deploys to ICP canisters, and preserves reconstructible state for resilient automation."

- **Secondary CTA**: "Read v1.0 tutorial"

### Trust + proof bar

## Install page outline (`/install`)
